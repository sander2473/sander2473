- 👋 Hi, I’m @sander2473
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about front-end development and/or maybe data science as possible career paths. I enjoy coding, but right now don't know enough to know what kind of coding might be best for me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS (more of it), JavaScript and learning about data science and what might be involved in that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... get back to me on this as I learn more.
- 📫 How to reach me. Probably best to get me with a DM at @sanderaSTL on Twitter.
